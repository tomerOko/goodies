# DEPLOYMENTS #
# a deployment is an abstruction level above pod, it is a k8s object,
# and it used to *manage a repilca set of a pod*
# some of the main deployment responsabilities are:
# * restart a replica in case of failure
# * manage updates, lets say there 3 replicas, while updating the deployment
#   will shut down one replica and start an updated one, than again, and agin. and the we got 3 updated replicas

#             and u are right, i dont know why it inst working that way and
#             why we need to specify a 'selection rules' instead
